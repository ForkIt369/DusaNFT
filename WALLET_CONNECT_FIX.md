# ✅ MetaMask Connection Fixed!

The app now has robust MetaMask detection and error handling:

## What Was Fixed:
1. **Waits for MetaMask** - Up to 3 seconds for extension to load
2. **Clear error messages** - Tells you exactly what's wrong
3. **Network switching** - Automatically adds/switches to Metis
4. **Account detection** - Handles locked/unlocked states

## To Test:
1. **Refresh the page** (Cmd+R or Ctrl+R)
2. **Make sure MetaMask is:**
   - Installed
   - Unlocked (enter password if needed)
   - Visible in browser toolbar
3. **Click "Connect Wallet"**

## If Still Having Issues:
1. Open browser console (Right-click → Inspect → Console)
2. Look for specific errors
3. Try:
   - Refreshing MetaMask (click extension icon)
   - Reloading the page
   - Checking if MetaMask is on a different account

The app will now:
- Detect if MetaMask isn't installed
- Wait for it to load
- Guide you through network setup
- Show helpful error messages

Your wallet is whitelisted and ready to mint!
