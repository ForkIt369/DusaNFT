# Automated Deployment Options for Ledger

## Option 1: Frame.sh (Recommended)
**Best for:** Desktop deployment with Ledger

1. Install Frame: https://frame.sh
2. Connect your Ledger to Frame
3. Run: `node scripts/deploy-with-frame.js`

**Pros:** Works seamlessly with Ledger, no browser needed
**Cons:** Requires Frame installation

## Option 2: Direct Ledger Connection
**Best for:** Command line deployment

```bash
node scripts/deploy-ledger-direct.js
```

**Pros:** Direct control, no intermediaries
**Cons:** More complex setup

## Option 3: WalletConnect
**Best for:** Mobile + Ledger Live

```bash
node scripts/deploy-walletconnect.js
```

**Pros:** Works with Ledger Live mobile
**Cons:** Requires QR code scanning

## Option 4: Remix Plugin (Future)
Currently, Remix doesn't have MCP integration, but you could:
- Use Remix API
- Create a browser extension
- Use Selenium for automation

## Why Manual Remix is Still Best

For Ledger users, manual Remix deployment is actually optimal because:
1. ✅ Visual confirmation of everything
2. ✅ No additional software needed
3. ✅ Most secure (you verify each step)
4. ✅ Works immediately

## Quick Manual Deploy
Since you already have everything set up:
1. Copy contract from `DusaNFT_Remix.sol`
2. Go to remix.ethereum.org
3. Paste, compile, deploy
4. Takes ~5 minutes total

The automated options are here if you need them, but manual Remix is perfectly fine for a one-time deployment!
